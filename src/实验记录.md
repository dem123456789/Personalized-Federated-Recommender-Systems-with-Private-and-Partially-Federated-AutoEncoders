实验记录:

1. SGD, lr = 0.1, local_epoch = 5, scheduler = CosinAnnealingLR, epoch = 800, fraction = 0.1, user = 943, batch_size = 1, RMSE ≈ 1(最后收敛速度慢)
1. SGD, lr = 0.1, local_epoch = 5, scheduler = CosinAnnealingLR, epoch = 800, fraction = 0.1, user = 943, batch_size = 10, RMSE ≈ 1(最后收敛速度慢)

改动平均方法和scheduler后:

1. SGD, lr = 0.1, local_epoch = 5, scheduler = CosinAnnealingLR, epoch = 800, fraction = 0.1, user = 943, batch_size = 10, RMSE ≈ 1.025





Dear Professor Ali Anwar,

I would like to express my deepest appreciation for letting me have this interview chance. I was wondering if we could make it at Friday morning at 9 a.m. and if there is  anything I need to prepare beforehand. Thank you very much !

Sincerely,
